    Store value as maxGuesses
    Also store it as guessLeft

Program finds a random value between 0 and 25

    Ask user for their guess 
    store it as an interger labeled userGuess
    add it to a list called allGuesses

    if userGuess = guessMe
        Print "Damn you win!
        Print "The number was indeed " show userGuess
        Print "You guessed it in " show len of allGuesses "guesses!"
        Print "Your guess log: "
        Print allGuesses
        break out of the loop

    else
    Take away one from "guessLeft"
    if userGuess < guessMe
        print "Nope, its greater than that!"
        Print "You have " guessLeft "guesses left!"
    else
        print "Nope, its less than that!"
